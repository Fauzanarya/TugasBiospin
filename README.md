HIGH PASS FILTER



High pass filter frequency at 586 Hz to 863 Hz

A. FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) a compter used in digital signal processing to modify, filter and decode digital audio, video and images.

FFT are used to sharpen edges and create effects in static images and are widely used to turn number series into sine waves and graphs.

Based on the picture, the x signal looks tenuous while the y signal looks dense. From the combination of these signals, z signal is irregular in shape.

C.

From the results of z signal analysis, a higher and louder sound was obtained. this happens because z signal can be said  "noise" which is supported by an irregular signal shape.
